    "together, they may rapidly approach zero and even get rounded to 0, which will\n",
    "make it difficult or impossible for you to compare the actual values accurately.\n",
    "Instead, you can take the log of the probability, which will transform the\n",

    "log is a monotonically increasing function, if $log(x) > log(y)$ then $x > y$.\n",

    "* There are a few different ways you can go about storing the information from\n",
